A Keynesian Beauty Contest is a game theory concept proposed by John Maynard Keynes. 
He describes a beauty contest where the judges are instructed to choose the contestant they believe will be most popular among all the judges, rather than by their own opinion, and are offered a prize if they choose the contestand who ends up being the most popular.
In other words, each judge is asked to rank based on what they believe is a public of beauty, rather than a personal one. 
Keynes felt that this was reminiscent of stock market dynamics, where buying and selling decisions were less concerned with fundamental value than with public perceptions of value. 

This contract was inspired by Keynes' ideas - a question and two potential answers are posed, and users have the opportunity to bet on which answer they believe will be more popular (determined by which answer ends up having more eth bet on it)
After a fixed period the contest ends, and the winning bettors get their funds back, plus a proportional amount of the funds forfeited by the losing bettors, who receive nothing.

Considerations: Bets are capped at 2 eth to prevent wealthy bettors from making outsize bets near the end of the contest to secure a win (this is still possible, but to do so would require making multiple 2 eth bets from separate accounts, which requires more effort and more tx fees)
